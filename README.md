Source code for breadboard TNC based on STM32L432KC Nucleo32 dev board

# Build Instructions for the Breadboard TNC3

The Breadboard TNC3 is a TNC based on the microcontroller family and firmware
used in the Mobilinkd TNC3.  The breadboard TNC3 contains the microcontroller,
audio input and output circuitry, PTT signalling circuitry and EEPROM for
storing configuration that is nearly identical to the TNC3.  It only lacks the
Bluetooth adapter and battery charging circuitry.

The Breadboard TNC3 connects to a computer (or Android device with a USB-OTG
adapter) via a USB cable.

## Bill of Materials

The Breadboard TNC3 is designed around the STMicroelectronics Nucleo32 board
with the STM32L432KC chip.  The total bill of materials (BOM) cost is about
$25 (USD).

You will need:

 - 830-point breadboard (standard single row) or larger.
 - STM Nucleo32-L432KC dev board
 - 2 2N7009 N-channel MOSFETs (TO-92)
 - 2 Schottky diodes
 - 1 MCP6004 4-channel op amp (14-PDIP)
 - 1 AT24C32E-PUM 32kb I2C EEPROM (8-PDIP)
 - 1 Red LED
 - 1 Green LED
 - 1 TRRS 3.5mm 4-pole jack
 - various resistors and capacitors
 - Hookup wire
